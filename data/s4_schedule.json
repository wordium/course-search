They are an essential natural resource providing multiple benefits to society, and play a key role in the supply of fresh water and the regulation of climate. Changes in forested landscapes raise concerns about the volume of water flowing to streams, timing of those flows, and water quality. This seminar explores hydrology in forested watersheds and its relevance to contemporary issues. A first emphasis is hydrological processes, introducing factors that affect water budgets, flow paths, and runoff generation. A second emphasis is impacts of forest management activities on water yield, water quality, and sustainability of forest resources. ",

We will pay particular attention to the categories of personhood that make up the UC Berkeley American Cultures rubric (race and ethnicity), as well as to gender, nation, and disability. The argument threading through the course will be the ways in which new media both reinforce pre-existing social hierarchies, and yet offer possibilities for the transcendence of those very categories. The new media -- and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester -- can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.

What is meant by the charge that there is an \"overmedication of everyday life\" in our society and is that charge justified? What is \"medical reductionism\" and what are its limits? What are the assumptions behind \"specialistic\" and holistic\"approaches to medicine and which of these two approaches serves better the aims of medicine? What is the proper place of medicine in the social, legal, and moral contexts? ",

Biological questions considered include, but are not limited to, modeling meiosis; genetic mapping; nucleotide and protein-sequence analysis; molecular evolution; computational gene finding; and DNA microarray experiments. The course also introduces statistical computing resources for the analysis of biological data, with emphasis on the R language and environment (www.r-project.org) and bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org). In addition, the course introduces basic notions in genetics and molecular biology and involves the critical reading of articles related to statistical analyses in the biological and medical sciences.

Class readings, and discussions explore the post-World War II crisis within modernism, postmodernism within and beyond architectural culture, and more recent developments around issues such as rapid urbanization, sustainability, the politics of cultural identity and globalization. Transformations in architectural theory are examined in relation to historical forces such as the economy, the growth and transformation of cities, and the changing relationship between design professions and disciplines. The influences of digital media, new materials and production techniques on architectural education and practice are explored and the implications for architectural theory assessed. Key issues are anchored in case studies of buildings, urban spaces, and the institutions and agents or architectural culture. ",
