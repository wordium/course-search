Statistical topics, introduced in a biological context, include numerical and graphical summaries of data; basic notions in probability; loss-based estimation (e.g., least-squares regression, maximum likelihood estimation); model selection; multiple hypothesis testing; Markov chains; hidden Markov models, resampling; simulation studies. Biological questions considered include, but are not limited to, modeling meiosis; genetic mapping; nucleotide and protein-sequence analysis; molecular evolution; computational gene finding; and DNA microarray experiments. The course also introduces statistical computing resources for the analysis of biological data, with emphasis on the R language and environment (www.r-project.org) and bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org). In addition, the course introduces basic notions in genetics and molecular biology and involves the critical reading of articles related to statistical analyses in the biological and medical sciences.
