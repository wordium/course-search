These issues intersect with those of race, class, and culture in U.S. society. This course focuses on engineering ethics case studies as they apply to issues of workplace diversity, sustainable practices, economic impacts on neighborhoods and nations, and issues of security and identity. The goal of this course is to broaden the understanding of engineering ethics from individual and business-based practices to those affecting communities and nations. This class cannot be used to satisfy any Engineering requirement (technical electives, engineering units, or courses). ",

They are an essential natural resource providing multiple benefits to society, and play a key role in the supply of fresh water and the regulation of climate. Changes in forested landscapes raise concerns about the volume of water flowing to streams, timing of those flows, and water quality. This seminar explores hydrology in forested watersheds and its relevance to contemporary issues. A first emphasis is hydrological processes, introducing factors that affect water budgets, flow paths, and runoff generation. A second emphasis is impacts of forest management activities on water yield, water quality, and sustainability of forest resources. ",

Internships are approved in advance by the faculty coordinator with whom each student will be required to meet regularly and plan out complementary readings and regular written reports. Work commitments will range between 180-360 hours depending upon the number of units undertaken and the length of the term enrolled. Final assessments will be based upon performance in the internship, quality of written reports and a final assessment by the faculty advisor. Internship is repeatable for up to 16 units.

The new media--and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester--can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.

In addition, this course satisfies the American Cultures requirement and will contribute to understanding of race, cultures, and ethnicity in the United States.

The new media -- and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester -- can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.

Transformations in architectural theory are examined in relation to historical forces such as the economy, the growth and transformation of cities, and the changing relationship between design professions and disciplines. The influences of digital media, new materials and production techniques on architectural education and practice are explored and the implications for architectural theory assessed. Key issues are anchored in case studies of buildings, urban spaces, and the institutions and agents or architectural culture. ",
