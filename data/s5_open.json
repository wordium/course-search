Using a project in which students will be asked to design and develop a product or service focused on sustainability, we will teach processes for collecting customer and user needs data, prioritizing that data, developing a product specification, sketching and building product prototypes, and interacting with the customer/community during product development. The course is intended as a very hands-on experience in the \"green\" product development process. The course will be a Management of Technology course offered jointly with the College of Engineering and the Haas School of Business. In addition, it will also receive credit towards the new Certificate on Engineering Sustainability and Environmental Management program. We aim to have half MBA students and half Engineering students (with a few other students, such as from the School of Information) in the class. The instructors will facilitate students to form mixed disciplinary reams for the development of their \"green\" products. ",

Key programs and policies for the elderly will be examined in sociohistorical perspective with attention to their salience in a multicultural society. The course will be offered at the undergraduate (upper division) level to meet the American Cultures requirement, but is also open to graduate students and will serve as an elective for the new Multicultural Health Specialty Area in the School of Public Health.

Statistical topics, introduced in a biological context, include numerical and graphical summaries of data; basic notions in probability; loss-based estimation (e.g., least-squares regression, maximum likelihood estimation); model selection; multiple hypothesis testing; Markov chains; hidden Markov models, resampling; simulation studies. Biological questions considered include, but are not limited to, modeling meiosis; genetic mapping; nucleotide and protein-sequence analysis; molecular evolution; computational gene finding; and DNA microarray experiments. The course also introduces statistical computing resources for the analysis of biological data, with emphasis on the R language and environment (www.r-project.org) and bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org). In addition, the course introduces basic notions in genetics and molecular biology and involves the critical reading of articles related to statistical analyses in the biological and medical sciences.

The argument threading through the course will be the ways in which new media both reinforce pre-existing social hierarchies, and yet offer possibilities for the transcendence of those very categories. The new media -- and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester -- can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.

Class readings, and discussions explore the post-World War II crisis within modernism, postmodernism within and beyond architectural culture, and more recent developments around issues such as rapid urbanization, sustainability, the politics of cultural identity and globalization. Transformations in architectural theory are examined in relation to historical forces such as the economy, the growth and transformation of cities, and the changing relationship between design professions and disciplines. The influences of digital media, new materials and production techniques on architectural education and practice are explored and the implications for architectural theory assessed. Key issues are anchored in case studies of buildings, urban spaces, and the institutions and agents or architectural culture. ",
