The new media--and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester--can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.

This research perspicaciously and critically analyzes extant literature on literacy teaching and learning. This literature will be examined in practice through participation in tutoring and technology-oriented summer programs. In addition, this course satisfies the American Cultures requirement and will contribute to understanding of race, cultures, and ethnicity in the United States. We will develop a view of literacy, not as a neutral skill, but as embedded within culture and as depending for its meaning and its practice upon social institutions and conditions. In addition to lecture, students are to participate in field work hours. ",

Class readings, and discussions explore the post-World War II crisis within modernism, postmodernism within and beyond architectural culture, and more recent developments around issues such as rapid urbanization, sustainability, the politics of cultural identity and globalization. Transformations in architectural theory are examined in relation to historical forces such as the economy, the growth and transformation of cities, and the changing relationship between design professions and disciplines. The influences of digital media, new materials and production techniques on architectural education and practice are explored and the implications for architectural theory assessed. Key issues are anchored in case studies of buildings, urban spaces, and the institutions and agents or architectural culture. ",
