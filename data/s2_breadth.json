The argument threading through the course will be the ways in which new media both reinforce preexisting social hierarchies and yet offer possibilities for the transcendence of those very categories. The new media--and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester--can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.

Key programs and policies for the elderly will be examined in sociohistorical perspective with attention to their salience in a multicultural society. The course will be offered at the undergraduate (upper division) level to meet the American Cultures requirement, but is also open to graduate students and will serve as an elective for the new Multicultural Health Specialty Area in the School of Public Health.

Biological questions considered include, but are not limited to, modeling meiosis; genetic mapping; nucleotide and protein-sequence analysis; molecular evolution; computational gene finding; and DNA microarray experiments. The course also introduces statistical computing resources for the analysis of biological data, with emphasis on the R language and environment (www.r-project.org) and bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org). In addition, the course introduces basic notions in genetics and molecular biology and involves the critical reading of articles related to statistical analyses in the biological and medical sciences.
