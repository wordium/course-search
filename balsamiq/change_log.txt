Changes to our Balsamiq interactions
====================================

4/26
• modified the comparison stuff to be at the bottom of the Saved screen with toggle btwn calendar and details
• deprecated the old Save and Compare screens (so we have things for our presentation screenshots)

4/22
• Modified the comparison screen to have some data elements closed by default, and to add 
  a calendar at the bottom. 
      -NOTE: There are now two compare screens, one with all elements open and one with some closed.
      The closed one is the one that everything links to.
      -NOTE: No interactions have been created for opening and closing compare screen data elements.

4/19
• Changed save icons to reduce confusion about the + button meaning "expand" rather than "save"
• Linked all "Saved Courses" links on Results A pages to 14-saved
	-Note: did not update the number on that link, I figured it was equally confusing to change it and to leave it
• Added a saving interaction on ARCH 100, Modern Building Materials, from 3-results-A-doubleheight (see pages 
  15-saving-interaction and 16-after-saving)
	-Note: I did not update any of the other results pages to include the changed icons that would result from them being on the 
	saved list; this seemed like it would be confusing to users unless we took them through saving interactions for each one
• Added a Compare interaction:
    -From the Saved Courses screen, selecting any one of ARCH 100, ANTH C262B, and ANTH 151 takes you to a screen where all 
    three are selected (17-compare-choose)
    -From there, clicking either of the Compare Selected buttons takes you to a comparison screen (18-compare), 
    showing three classes and a dropdown to add more (which is viewable but not interactive (19-compare-dropdown)
• Note: all Save and Compare interactions are linked only to Results A screens

THESE CHANGES HAVE ALL BEEN QA'd BY LJ BUT SHOULD BE QA'd AGAIN BY SYH.
